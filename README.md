# ThermoPower

Free library to model thermal power plants (based on Modelica.Media)

## Library description

The ThermoPower library is a free Modelica library for the dynamic modelling of thermal power plants. The library has been developed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of plants, with the purpose of studying control system strategies and architectures.


A general description of the library can be found in the papers:
 * F. Casella, A. Leva, "[Modelica open library for power plant simulation: design and experimental validation](http://www.modelica.org/Conference2003/papers/h08_Leva.pdf)", Proceedings of the 2003 Modelica Conference, Link&ouml ping, Sweden, 2003.
 * F. Casella, A. Leva, "[Modelling of Thermo-Hydraulic Power Generation Processes Using Modelica](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13873950500071082)". Mathematical and Computer Modeling of Dynamical Systems, vol. 12, n. 1, pp. 19-33, Feb. 2006.

ThermoPower 2.1 is the last major revision compatible with Modelica 2.1 and the Modelica Standard Library 2.2.x. The next version is planned to use Modelica 3.x and the Modelica Standard Library 3.x. It will use use stream connectors, which generalize the concept of Flange connectors, lifting the restrictions that only two complementary connectors can be bound.
